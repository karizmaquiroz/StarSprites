Shadows of Valle-Vidrio: 2D cozy platformer game.
Use WASD to move around. Space-bar to jump. Use the left click to shoot a small projectile.
As you level up, you will gain access to more abilities. To swap to another ability, press 1, 2, or 3 to change to those abilities.
To complete each level, clear all the enemies, kill the boss, and find the ward shard to progress to the next level. As you complete each level, collect furniture that you will use to decorate your home. Along with the furniture, you will also receive lore pages, which you can read when you stop by your cozy home.
To win the game, take what you've learned from prior enemies and defeat the final boss. Restore peace to your forest home!

Camera Control:
Depending on what level you are on, you can access different camera controls.
  Level 1: 
    Narrow view (Key bind "N") where the camera view is mostly on the player.
    Wide view (key bind "M") where the camera view showcases the player and a bit of the surroundings.
    Level view (key bind "L"): The camera view showcases the entire level. This can be optimal for the player, as you can see the game area.
  Level 2: 
    Narrow view (Key bind "N") where the camera view is mostly on the player.
    Wide view (key bind "M") where the camera view showcases the player and a bit of the surroundings.
    Cave view: This is not controlled by the player, as when the player enters the cave, the camera snaps to the designated area.
  Level 3 and boss:
    There is only the Level view. This level view is not controllable by the player, as we want the player to have the best gaming experience fighting the enemies and the boss.

## Requirements met:
Our main menu system is fully functional, with the start button leading into a cut scene before the first of three levels. Our third level is actually split in two for narrative reasons, but still stands as one level within the same environment. The game is complete from a development and storytelling perspective. Not only is the player able to complete the game, but they are also able to visit a "home" level where they can explore collected lore pages and decorate. This should also meet the requirement of sufficient game content. 

##External files will be attached in the zip file.
